# vot iz zrunner

its a python utility to manage the running zrok sessions to serve the websites. it is to ensure that the zrok sessions dont stop, and if they do, get them back up online.

although that is the usecase, this is more general purpose and can be used to keep any service running over time, and periodically check if they are running normally.
